Hi there 👋🏻, I'm Ricardo aka Ricky, I'm using this website to learn and test all the potential of using AI to build stuff.

What have I implemented up to now:

* Domain setup.
* Website construction using Next.js, Vercel, GitHub
* Design changes and layout.
* Adding a CMS with Decap.
* Data Analytics with Countly.

To be done in the future: 

* A/B testing. 
* Newsletter setup.
* RSS feed.
* Comments in the blog.
